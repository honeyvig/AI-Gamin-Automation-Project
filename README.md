# AI-Gamin-Automation-Project
create a gaming automation solution where the AI plays the game autonomously.

The game would be eFootball (Steam version, not other version)

The objective is to have autonomus AI to be able to play online against random human opponent & win more than 80% of the game with its ability to understand which side is the team playing, scoring, passing, etc..

I dont need the AI to be able to select the players or the tactics/whatever not related to the gameplay itself.

whether its going to be GUI/CLI/etc, doesnt matter.. the results matter
---------
Creating an AI that autonomously plays a game like eFootball (Steam version) and wins more than 80% of the games requires a few essential components. The AI needs to interact with the gameâ€™s graphical user interface (GUI) to recognize the current state of the game (such as the position of players, ball, score, etc.) and make decisions to perform actions like passing, shooting, and defending.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach building an autonomous AI for this game:
Key Components:

    Game State Recognition:
        The AI needs to interpret the screen in real-time and understand the positions of players, ball, goals, and the score.
        This can be achieved through Computer Vision (CV) techniques like OpenCV and Image Recognition.

    Action Decision Making:
        Once the game state is recognized, the AI needs to make decisions on the actions to perform (e.g., dribbling, passing, shooting).
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve decision-making over time, learning from previous games.

    Input Simulation:
        The AI will need to simulate mouse and keyboard inputs or controller inputs to control the players in the game.
        PyAutoGUI or Pynput can be used to simulate mouse and keyboard actions.

    Gameplay Strategy:
        The AI will not be involved in selecting tactics, but will need to understand the gameplay mechanics (e.g., how to pass, shoot, defend).
        Techniques like Deep Q-Learning (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) could be used to train the AI agent to play effectively.

Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. Game State Recognition:

To recognize the game state, we need to capture the screen and analyze it. This could involve detecting the ball's position, the players, the score, etc.

pip install opencv-python pyautogui numpy

import cv2
import numpy as np
import pyautogui

def capture_screen():
    # Capture the screen (entire screen or specific region)
    screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
    screenshot_np = np.array(screenshot)
    screenshot_cv2 = cv2.cvtColor(screenshot_np, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
    return screenshot_cv2

def process_image(image):
    # Here, you can add image processing logic to recognize specific objects like the ball or players
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # Example of simple object detection (use more advanced techniques like template matching or deep learning models for better accuracy)
    return gray

# Capture and process a frame
frame = capture_screen()
processed_frame = process_image(frame)

# Show the processed frame
cv2.imshow('Processed Frame', processed_frame)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

2. Action Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning:

Once the game state is recognized, we need an AI agent to decide which action to take (e.g., dribble, pass, shoot). One of the best ways to train the AI for this is using Reinforcement Learning (RL), where the agent learns optimal actions through trial and error.

For this, we will use TensorFlow or PyTorch to train the agent.

pip install tensorflow keras gym

import gym
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a simple neural network for decision making
def create_model(state_size, action_size):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(24, activation='relu', input_shape=(state_size,)),
        layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(action_size, activation='linear')  # Output actions
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mse')
    return model

# Initialize the agent model
state_size = 10  # Example: Number of features in the state (e.g., player positions, ball position)
action_size = 5  # Example: Number of possible actions (e.g., pass, shoot, defend, etc.)
model = create_model(state_size, action_size)

# Sample action (for simplicity)
state = np.random.random((1, state_size))  # Simulated game state
action = model.predict(state)  # Predict which action to take

print(f"Predicted Action: {action}")

3. Input Simulation:

To control the game, the AI needs to send inputs such as keyboard presses or mouse movements. We can use PyAutoGUI to simulate these inputs.

import pyautogui

def send_action_to_game(action):
    # Simulate key presses based on the action predicted by the AI
    if action == 0:  # Example: Action 0 is to pass
        pyautogui.press('w')  # Simulate a 'w' key press for passing
    elif action == 1:  # Action 1 is to shoot
        pyautogui.press('space')  # Simulate a spacebar press for shooting
    elif action == 2:  # Action 2 is to defend
        pyautogui.press('s')  # Simulate 's' key press for defending
    elif action == 3:  # Action 3 is to move forward
        pyautogui.press('up')  # Simulate arrow key press for moving forward
    elif action == 4:  # Action 4 is to move left
        pyautogui.press('left')  # Simulate left arrow key press

# Example: Use AI to decide action and then send it to the game
send_action_to_game(0)  # For simplicity, let's assume AI decided to pass the ball

4. Full Integration:

Now that we have all components, we can put everything together. The AI will capture the game state, process the image, predict the next action using a neural network, and send the corresponding input to the game.

def play_game():
    while True:
        # Step 1: Capture the current screen (game state)
        screen = capture_screen()

        # Step 2: Process the captured screen (e.g., detect players, ball, etc.)
        processed_screen = process_image(screen)

        # Step 3: Extract state features (e.g., ball position, player positions, score, etc.)
        game_state = extract_game_state(processed_screen)

        # Step 4: Use the AI model to decide the next action
        action = model.predict(game_state)

        # Step 5: Send the action to the game (e.g., pass, shoot, etc.)
        send_action_to_game(action)

        # Optionally, you could add some sleep to avoid overloading the system or game

# Play the game autonomously
play_game()

Training the AI:

To improve performance and accuracy, you would need to train the reinforcement learning agent. This involves creating a reward system where the AI gets rewards for performing well (e.g., scoring goals, making successful passes) and penalties for bad actions (e.g., conceding goals, losing possession).
Conclusion:

This code provides the structure for building an autonomous AI agent to play eFootball on Steam. The AI can capture the game state, process it, decide on actions, and simulate input. Over time, with training using reinforcement learning, the AI will improve its performance, potentially achieving the goal of winning 80% of games against human opponents.

Please note that this is a simplified approach, and in practice, achieving 80% win rates will require sophisticated computer vision for state recognition, advanced reinforcement learning algorithms for training, and a robust simulation environment.
